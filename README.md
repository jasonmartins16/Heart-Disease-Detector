# Heart-Disease-Detector
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms and deploys the solution via FastAPI with an interactive web interface.

# Features
->Machine learning model built with Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions.
->Data preprocessing with StandardScaler for normalized feature distribution.
->Backend API powered by FastAPI, enabling real-time predictions.
->Web interface built with HTML and Tailwind CSS for user-friendly input.
->Displays both prediction (Normal / Heart Disease) and risk probability.
->Custom threshold adjustment to improve sensitivity for heart disease detection.
